# **App Name**: Harvest Logger

## Core Features:

- CRUD operations for lots, harvests, and workers: Create, read, update, and delete lots, harvests and worker data. This is achieved through a sequence of screens for selecting a 'Lot' then a 'Harvest' within that lot, and finally a screen to enter data on the workers.
- Local data persistence: The application reads and writes all data using IndexedDB.
- Capture payment data: Download a screenshot of the worker's payment data.

## Style Guidelines:

- The primary color, #1a5e1a, is derived from the concept of agriculture. It evokes a sense of growth, nature, and sustainability. Choosing green as the primary tone fits in perfectly with a dark color scheme.
- The background color is a very dark shade of green, specifically #0a0e0a.  This background emphasizes content by providing a high degree of contrast.
- The accent color, #5e1a1a, is an analogous color to the primary. Its darker tone stands out against the primary to highlight user interface elements without stealing the show.
- Clean and readable typography.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent actions and data types.
- A clear, tab-based or navigation-based layout to switch between Lots, Harvests, and data entry views.
- Subtle transitions between views and form elements.
